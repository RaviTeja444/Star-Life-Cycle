# STAR LIFE CYCLE
When we look into the sky at night we usually watch a lot of beautiful stars.There are billions of such stars in each of the Galaxies.A star shines because of the nuclear fusion happening inside them i.e two hydrogen atoms colliding to form one Helium atom and releasing energy as a by product.A star life cycle is one of the interesting and exciting part of the whole Universe.A star born from the dust and energy can end up forming a

- **Dwarf Star**
- **Neutron Star**
- **Black Hole**

## Life Cycle of a Star
There are different stages in the life time of a star.
1. Star
1. Red giant
1. Red Super giant
1. White Dwarf
1. Neutron Star
1. Black Hole

A star becoming a Black hole or not depends on its mass which is proposed by the scientist *Subramanyam Chandrasekhar*.Any star with mass less or equal to 1.4 times the mass of sun will end up forming white-dwarf and the stars having mass greater than that will form either a Neutron star or Black Hole.Neutron Stars are extremely dense objects rotating extremely fast with around 20 km in diameter.

A Black Hole is highest form of Gravitation Collapse of a star.Nothing can escape from a black hole's gravity including light.So we can never see a blackhole because light is not reflected back but scientists understand their presence by its impact on other objects in the cosmic Universe.

Elements higher than iron like Uranuim and way up are formed as part of Supernova explosion which is considered as the most extreme and biggest explosion in the Universe.Extreme pressure formed which is way more than normal fusion allows it form elements higher than the stable element Iron.
